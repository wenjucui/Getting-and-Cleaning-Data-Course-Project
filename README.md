An R script called run_analysis.R is created and does the following:

   2. Unzip the file
   3. Read in activity labels and features
   4. Read in train and test data
   5. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   6. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   7. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
   8. Merge modified train and test data sets
   9. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To run the sript, please follow the instructions in the script.

The final tidy dataset is "tidy.txt".
